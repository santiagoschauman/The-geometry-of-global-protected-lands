ModelBuilder Exposure Level tool (ArcGIS v 10.8).
#########

We performed the ModelBuilder Exposure Level Tool to develop an analytical workflow for calculating the exposure level of protected lands, which aids in the reproducibility and replicability of our analysis. However, for the purposes of "The Geometry of Global Protected Lands: Implications for Nature Conservation and Human Well-Being," we performed the exposure level analysis by subsetting the WDPA database by continents and conducting the analysis step-by-step to reduce computational burden.

#########
Note: A geodatabase (Exposure Level Geodatabase/ ExposureTool GDB.gdb.rar) is provided to facilitate an example of the calculation of the exposure level, including:
* Cultural regions database.
* Biomes database.
* WDPA database (subset of protected areas).

ModelBuilder Exposure Level Tool

1-Input Data: WDPA database.
2-Dissolve: aggregates protected area polygons. 
3-Feature to Line: creates a feature class containing lines generated by converting polygon boundaries to lines (edges of protected areas). 
4-Euclidean Distance: calculates, for each cell, the Euclidean distance to the closest source. Parameters: Maximum distance; Output cell size. 
5-Clip: the Euclidean Distance raster is clipped by the WDPA database in order to 
obtain the internal distances to edges. 
6-Raster to Point: converts the Euclidean Distance raster to point features.
Parameters: Field (the field to assign values from the cells in the input raster to the points in the output dataset).
7-Join WDPA: Joins attributes from the Points distances to the WDPA database based on the spatial relationship.
8-Join Cultural Regions: Spatial Join with the Cultural Regions database.
9-Join Biomes: Spatial Join with the Biomes database.

The final output “ExposureLevelDatabase” is stored in the Default Geodatabase. In order to subsequently run the tool, the temporary output file must be removed.
