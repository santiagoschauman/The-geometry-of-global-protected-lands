#Maximum depth 

Calculated as the distance from the PA innermost point to its closer edge.

For maximum depth calculation we transformed the PA polygon network into a one of PA edges using the “feature to line” tool in ArcGIS Pro 2.8. 
We calculated the distance to the closest edge for cells with a spatial resolution of 300 m. Finally, we calculated the “maximum depth” 
for each polygon as the maximum distance to the closest edge using the “Zonal statistics as table” tool in ArcGIS Pro 2.8.

# Depth compactness

Calculated as the ratio of the PA Maximum depth to the radius of a circle equal in size to the PA.

Translated into PostGIS:

1. ALTER TABLE wdpa_mar2023 ADD COLUMN depth_compactness double precision;

2. UPDATE wdpa_mar2023
SET depth_compactness = Maximum depth/|/area/pi();
