# Elongation 

1. ALTER TABLE wdpa_mar2023 ADD COLUMN elongation double precision;

2. UPDATE wdpa_mar2023
SET elongation = ST_Length(ST_GeometryN(ST_MinimumBoundingRectangle(wdpa_mar2023.geom), 1)) / ST_Length(ST_GeometryN(ST_MinimumBoundingRectangle(wdpa_mar2023.geom), 2));

Note: Here, ST_GeometryN is used to obtain each side of the oriented minimum bounding box, and ST_Length is used to obtain the length of each side.
The polygons returned by ST_MinimumBoundingRectangle have four sides, so the values "1" to "4" can be used with ST_GeometryN to obtain each side of the polygon.
